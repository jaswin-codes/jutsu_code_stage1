# Jutsu Code — User Guide

> How to use the system, what signs to perform, and how to trigger each jutsu.

---

## Setup

1. Open VS Code in the `jutsu_code` folder
2. Activate the virtual environment in the terminal:
   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
4. A window will open showing your webcam feed
5. Press **Q** to quit at any time

---

## How It Works

1. Hold a sign in front of the camera
2. Keep it **steady** until the sign name appears on screen (~0.5 seconds)
3. **Change** to the next sign in the sequence — holding the same sign does nothing
4. Complete the full combo sequence to trigger the jutsu
5. The screen will flash and the jutsu name will appear
6. The sequence resets automatically — you can go again immediately

---

## Tips for Best Detection

- Keep your hand **facing the camera** (palm toward you or slightly angled)
- Use **good lighting** — avoid backlighting (don't sit with a window behind you)
- Keep your hand **roughly 30–60cm** from the camera
- Move **deliberately** between signs — don't rush
- If a sign isn't being detected, **re-centre** your hand and hold it steadier

> **UP = 1 (finger extended)** | **DOWN = 0 (finger curled)**

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Sign not being detected | Hold hand steadier, face palm more toward camera |
| Sign flickering between two values | Improve lighting, move hand closer |
| Combo not triggering | Make sure each sign **confirms** before moving to next |
| Thumb always showing UP | Normal — thumb is less reliable, some signs use wildcard |
| Camera not opening | Change `VideoCapture(0)` to `VideoCapture(1)` in main.py |
| Program crashes on start | Make sure venv is activated before running |
